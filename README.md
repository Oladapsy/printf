This is a printf Project.

It's purpose is to build the printf function and possibly all the argument or formats it can handle, ranging from %d to %i to %s and so on....

This codes were aimed not to do all it can but tackle only the mandatory part as there is limited time and i am busy with my college which we'll be working on this together.

My name is the one and only: OLADAPO ODEDEYI OLAYINKA
and my partner name is: OMOTOYOSI OLUWATOYIN

All the way from NIGERIA, AFRICA, EARTH, UNIVERSE...

Enjoy the code along...
